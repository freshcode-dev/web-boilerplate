## React-based projects routing

**!!!Important!!! Needs to be rewritten according to [major changes in react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/v6-data)**

When building frontend with React, make sure you fully utilize the main react-router capabilities.

Overall, a proper react routing setup should be modular, efficient, and easy to maintain. By following these best practices, you can create a routing setup that provides a seamless user experience and improves the performance of your app.

### `useRoutes`
Define your routes as objects that include a path and an element property. The path property specifies the URL that should match the route, while the element property defines the component that should render when the route is accessed.

The `useRoutes` hook is a new addition to the `react-router-dom` library that provides an alternative to the traditional component-based approach for defining routes.

The `useRoutes` hook provides a modern and flexible way to define routes in your React application, with improved performance and simplified syntax. While the component-based approach is still valid and useful in some scenarios, the `useRoutes` hook represents a significant improvement that is worth considering for most React routing setups

### Use lazy loading
Use lazy loading to improve performance by only loading the components that are needed. Use the `React.lazy()` function to load each component lazily, and wrap each element with a Suspense component to handle the loading state.

```typescript jsx
const AuthModuleRouter = lazy(async () => import('./modules/auth/auth.router'));
// ...
const routes = useRoutes([
	{ path: 'auth/*', element: <AuthModuleRouter /> }
]);
// ...
```

### Combine frontend modularity with lazy-loaded routing

The perfect way to apply lazy routing is to wrap each module of our modular frontend application with its own routing segment.
So each module has its own set of routes, and loads only when needed.

### Utilize as much standard API as possible
1. Use dynamic routing to handle dynamic URLs. You can use parameters in your path property to define dynamic segments of your URL. Use the useParams hook to access the values of these parameters in your component.
1. Use the `useNavigate` hook to programmatically navigate between routes. The useNavigate hook allows you to navigate to a new URL using JavaScript code instead of a link.
1. Use the `Link` component to create links that navigate to different routes within your app. The Link component creates a clickable link that will update the URL and render the appropriate component.
1. Use the `useLocation` hook to access information about the current URL. The useLocation hook allows you to access information about the current URL, including the pathname, search parameters, and hash.
1. Use the `useParams` hook to access dynamic route parameters. The useParams hook allows you to access the values of dynamic parameters defined in your path property.
1. Use the `useMatch` hook to access information about the current match. The useMatch hook allows you to access information about the current match, including the params object, path, and url.
1. Use the `Outlet` component to dynamically render nested routes without refreshing the page completely

### Always use guards at the highest level possible
Use routes protection to restrict users from accessing specific routes they don't have permissions for. 
Guard components are components that wrap other components with an extra logic that usually verifies user meets needed conditions and redirects if not.

```typescript jsx
// declare wrapper component with any logic you need...
export const RequireAuth = ({ children, isSignedIn }): ReactElement => {
	if (!isSignedIn) {
		return <Navigate to="/auth/login" replace />;
	}

	return children;
};
// and then wrap any route with it
const routes = useRoutes([
	{
		path: '/',
		element: <RequireUnauthorized><AuthorizedArea /></RequireUnauthorized>,
		children: [
			{ path: 'auth/*', element: <AuthModuleRouter /> },
			// ... other modules 
		]
	}
]);
```
It's important to group routes based on the security requirements you apply to them, so you can apply guards at the highest point possible. 

### Use area-components
When your routes are properly grouped into modules, or when UI-system designed to have lots of similarities 
between different pages, it might be worthy to introduce multiple levels of nesting.

To organize them properly, make sure you utilize the `Outlet` component mentioned above.
```typescript jsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

export const AuthorizedArea: FC = () => 
<div>
	<h1>Header shared by all the nested routes</h1>
	<Outlet />
</div>;
```
